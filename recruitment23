## Everything I've gone through for the Second Phase of Recruitment:

    HTML:
        Went thorugh s small course that taught me how to use the basics and helped me make a website with some help. I was able to use the basic data structures and so on to build a simple website using HTML.

    Automotive:
        Car Hacking Handbook:
                The first 3 chapters were read through and figured out.
                The whole model/item that we're trying to hack inot or get access inot has to be looked into through all the ways in order to get a clear vision on what to be misused/ fixed.
                It can be used to remotely take over a vehicle. Unlock a vehicle, Track a vehicle, etc....
                Different companies/ different countries choose different connections to make cars different and different to access.
                A few examples are Chrysler, Ford, USA, UK, etc...

    Embedded:
        Arduino:
            The basics of Arduino and bread board were learnt using yt as the main source.
            Wasn't able to learn C or any other languages (except for HTML and Python).
            Might be learning more for a project that i will be doing.

    picoCTF:
        Irish-Repo-1 and Cookie monster were done with the help of the igven hints.
        None of the challenges could be done by myself. I was able to learn more about the different places to store things and explore more about it.

    TinkerCAD:
        Used the software in order to create simple circuits.
        The given tasks felt a little difficult regarding the colour changing when a button is pressed.
